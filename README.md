# Simple-Movie-Database
This project demonstrates how to create and manage a simple movie database using Python and SQLite. The database stores information about movies, actors, and directors, and allows you to perform various SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights, such as finding movies by genre, listing directors and actors, and analyzing movie statistics.
The project uses Google Colab to combine Python programming and SQL for database creation, management, and querying. The SQLite database is managed in-memory using Pythonâ€™s sqlite3 library, and query results are displayed using the pandas library.
